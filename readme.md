# Odoo Experience 2025 - Write your website's custom JavaScript with Interactions

This repository comes in support of a talk given during the OXP25 on 18/09/2025 in Brussels.
I split each step in its own commit for better readability and to let the reader follow on
their own pace. If you have questions, please refer to the [documentation](https://gist.github.com/ged-odoo/62810b496cc95e798fa0f0c613013fb6).

## Commits

Note that the talk focused solely on `Interaction`s, which were introduced in Odoo 18.2.
This repository not only contains what was presented during the talk, but also sets the scene
around the interaction:

- **steps 1 and 2** show a static setup to create a website *snippet* (a block that can be
dropped on a website page)
- **steps 3 to 6** show an example of interaction, applied to the snippet created earlier.
- **step 7** adds an *edit interaction*, which is useful for the website builder.
- **steps 8.1 and 8.2** add some website builder options, with the new syntax (and the new
*html_builder* module) introduced with Odoo 19.

## Disclaimer

The code is given as is with no expected support and should not be used in a production environment.
